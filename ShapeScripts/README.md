# ShapeScriptz
## Useful for defining rooms with custom shapes into the floor plan
\
Simply place your verticies inside a script. In addition to supplying a name, an anchor point, and a list of positions and rotations \
This will generate a custom shape based on stright lines between your points. Your custom shape will then be placed at your point. The anchor point defines where the shape starts \
so if you place it at the bottom left corner of a square when you place you're square at 0,0 the bottom left coner will be at 0,0. Rotation will be around this point \
  
All files should end with .shz and can be read line a normal txt file. (Implmentation details for the script coming soon)
